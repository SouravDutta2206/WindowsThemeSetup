# WindowsThemeSetup
My current windows theme setup.

This setup is supposed to be as non destructive to base windows as much as possible and everything can be uninstalled from windows itself, restore point is not needed yes, but it is always a good thing to make one before doing something like this just in case.

This setup was done on Windows 11 Home Edition 24H2
